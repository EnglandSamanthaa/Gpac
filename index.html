                As we embark on a new school year, we'd like to welcome you to the Geneseo Performing Arts Council, affectionately known as GPAC. GPAC is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting the arts, including band, choir, speech, and theatre, in the Geneseo School District from kindergarten to 12th grade. If your child is involved in any of these programs, you are automatically a member of GPAC! We gather on the first Thursday of each month at 6:30 PM in the high school choir room, and we wholeheartedly invite everyone to join us. It's a fantastic way to connect with our directors and fellow parents, and we promise, we have a great time together!
            </p>
            <p>
                Annually, GPAC commits over $30,000 to bolster our arts programs, and this doesn't even account for the countless volunteer hours our community donates. We raise funds through various events and greatly rely on volunteers to ensure their success. For the 2022-2023 school year, our budget surpasses $40,000, and this doesn't include the $10,000 already spent on the new trailer and sound cart. Here's a brief overview of some recent GPAC contributions:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>$13,000+ in support of the Middle School music programs</li>
                <li>$1,500 in support of the Elementary Music programs</li>
                <li>Over $10,000 in support of the High School music programs</li>
                <li>$8,000 in support of Marching Band/Winter Drum Line</li>
                <li>$900 in support of the Speech program</li>
                <li>$3,500 in scholarships for Middle and High School Students pursuing arts-related endeavors</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Wondering how you can pitch in? GET INVOLVED! Attend a meeting, volunteer your time, or make a donation; every contribution counts! Our BIGGEST FUNDRAISER OF THE YEAR, Harvest Fest, provides a fantastic opportunity. Taking place on September 24-25, it accounts for 52% of our annual funding. Making Harvest Fest a success requires up to 350 volunteers. We invite you to spend a few hours volunteering with us this year. As a token of our appreciation, you'll receive complimentary entry to the Maple Leaf Marching Band Classic on Saturday. We've set up two sign-up options, one for adults and another exclusively for students. Please encourage any high school students you know to join the student sign-up. Details will be shared with them via email.
